            <p>I am an aspiring software devleloper who comes from a sales background. I work at Aspire Health as a patient enrollment
            specialist.Prior to working at Aspire, I worked for a non profit called CenterStone and was a realtor. I would lke to be a front-end
            developer. I am looking for a career that keeps me on my toes and gives me the opportunity to grow and learn. I love
            that I am able to be creative and think critically. I enjoy solving problems. I have always been intrigued as to how
            much technology has changed and helps billions of peoples lives. Through virtual schools to connecting familys on social
            media technology is changing the way we think and do. I want to be a part of the industrial revoltuation and contribute
            to the change and evolution of the world.</p>
